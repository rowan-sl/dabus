## TODO's

- [ ] figure out what the heck this standard is going to be
- [ ] deal with multiple handlers handling the same message type (in a better way than panicking)
- [ ] implement deregistering event handlers once [trait upcasting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65991) is implemented
